## Lazeal Cellist: Your Efficient 3D Cell Detection and Profiling Platform

Welcome to Lazeal Cellist, a comprehensive and efficient cell detection, segmentation, and profiling platform for 3D microscopy images.

Our platform is designed to detect cells using unsupervised learning, thresholding techniques, and state-of-the-art algorithms such as Cellpose. Lazeal Cellist also provides an intuitive, interactive interface that allows users to refine detection results. These refined results are then fed back into the semi-supervised learning network, continuously improving our model's performance.

Lazeal Cellist stands out by offering an efficient 3D model that requires minimal effort to train and refine, making it a game-changer for scientists, researchers, and hobbyists.

### Key Features

- **Unsupervised 3D Cell Detection**: Identify cells in 3D microscopy images using advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Interactive Result Refinement Interface**: Refine the detection results with an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
- **Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning Network**: Enhance the model's performance over time with your refined results.
- **Cell Segmentation and Profiling**: Go beyond detection with advanced segmentation and profiling capabilities.

### Inspired by Research

Lazeal Cellist is inspired by cutting-edge research in the field of deep learning, including:

1. "Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models"
2. "Spatially Invariant Attend, Infer, Repeat"
3. "Faster Attend-Infer-Repeat with Tractable Probabilistic Models"

These works provide valuable insights that have guided the development of our platform's algorithms and methodologies.
